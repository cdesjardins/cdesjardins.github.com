        <h3><a href="#">Tekelec RTOS work</a></h3>
        <div>
         At Tekelec I have had the chance to become very involved in the 
         development of low-level software for the following platforms:
         <ul>
           <li>VxWorks Kernel, and BSP development</li>
           <li>Proprietary OSs running on Arm based IXP1250, IXP2350, and EP9312 processors.</li>
           <li>Proprietary OSs running on many different x86 processors</li>
         </ul>
         <a href="images/e5.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot 1" src="images/e5-small.jpg" style="float:left;margin: 20px 20px"/></a>
         All of the above platforms ran on multi-processor distributed memory blades, which were part
         of a larger distributed real time message passing system that implemented the Tekelec Eagle 5
         platform which ran SS7 and related products such as SCCP, GTT, LNP, etc...
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">My VxWorks software development</a></h3>
        <div>
        <ul>
          <li>In system device programming (FPGA, CPLD, and Firmware hub)</li>
          <li>ISR handlers for Thermal conditions, battery voltages, clocks, and other Tekelec specific events</li>
          <li>SMBus interface routines</li>
          <li>CPU Thermal monitor and management <a href="patentapp.pdf">(patent pending)</a></li>
          <li>Application download</li>
          <li>Failsafe file system on top of dosFs</li>
          <li>Error handler/reporting application</li>
          <li>Custom NMI handler</li>
          <li>Boot loader</li>
        </ul>
        On all of the above projects (except the last two) I was the lead or sole engineer.
        Because I played such a large role in the development of OS level code, I was the primary contact
        for the hardware team during board bring up when software assistance was needed.<br/><br/>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">ARM Software development</a></h3>
        <div>
        I was able to develop software for many ARM processors, some software modules I worked on included:
        <ul>
          <li>CPU Interface code for Broadcom 5630 switch</li>
          <li>Application download</li>
          <li>Flash programming</li>
          <li>LED Controller</li>
          <li>Many other Tekelec specific modules</li>
        </ul>
        I was the sole engineer responsible for the Broadcom 5630 "light management interface", this was a major
        software development effort and a considerable management risk because this was the first
        time Tekelec had ever used a Broadcom switch in any product. However this project became 
        widely heralded because it went so smoothly, and the code has proven to be quite stable.<br/><br/>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">Next generation development</a></h3>
        <div>
        I also took a lead role in the design and development of the next generation of tekelec products which
        will be based on a dual core Intel platform. Because VxWorks does not fully support SMP we decided to 
        come up with our own VxWorks based multiprocessor solution. To do this we compile two VxWorks kernels
        and run one kernel on each core with a home grown shared memory inter-processor communication subsystem.
        My responsibilities in this effort included:
        <ul>
          <li>Initial board bring up</li>
          <li>Software architecture</li>
          <li>Designed and developed shared memory communication subsystem</li>
          <li>Designed and developed generic interrupt driven (IPI) inter-processor message passing mechanism</li>
          <li>File I/O device driver which allowes both cores to share the same flash file system</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h3><a href="#">Test application - PktGen</a></h3>
        <div>
        Another development effort that I got to lead was a system test tool for the Tekelec signal transfer point (STP)
        which enables Tekelc personnel to stress the backbone of the STP in a controlled fashion. The STP is basically 
        a large distributed multiprocessor blade system, where each blade in the STP has two processors. One processor
        is used for communication with other cards in the system, the second processor is used to run the application 
        designed for that blade. One STP may contain blades with processors from the 286 all the way up to the latest
        high speed Xeon and/or IXP processors. With this recent influx of powerful processors it has become very important
        to verify that the communication backbone is capable of supporting the full gamut of Tekelec blades. Prior to my
        start at Tekelec there was no way of thoroughly testing the communication backbone so I decided to take the initiative
        to create such a test application. 
        <br/><br/>
        The test appication consists of the following components:
        <ul>
          <li>UDP socket based server which runs on both Linux and VxWorks</li>
          <li>C++ dynamic link library (dll) which provides the Windows client side socket API</li>
          <li>MFC GUI application which links with the dll and enables users to preform directed tests</li>
          <li>Command line application which also links with the dll and enables users to write automated test cases with a simple single pass scripting language</li>
        </ul>
        This test tool was recently released for internal Tekelec useage, and is scheduled to ship to customer sites around Q3 2007.

          <div id="bops">
    <div class="accordion">      
      <h3><a href="#">Real time embedded OS work</a></h3>
      <div>
        I participated in the development of a RTOS for an embedded DSP core
        with a distributed memory architecture and many levels of parallelism.
        The OS kernel was less than 700 words, but it had the ability to overlay code 
        and data, schedule multiple concurrent threads, respond to I/O interrupts 
        quickly, and it abstracted the DMA engine so the user did not have to 
        write complex DMA transactions by hand.
        <p/>My primary responsibilities were to help design and develop the host 
        side component of the RTOS. The host component was basically an API that 
        a programmer could use to perform various functions such as, load modules
        on to the DSP core, communicate with the DSP, interrupt the DSP, perform
        I/O with the DSP, and schedule threads for execution. Due to the fact
        that the RTOS was going to be used with many different host environments I also
        developed a very low level general I/O API that I ported to every 
        host environment that BOPS supported (eCos, Windows, and Linux). This low
        level API made it very easy to develop BOPS DSP applications (such as the RTOS)
        that were targeted at more than one host system.
        <p/>I also helped develop the tool used to compile the
        <a href="images/glTrace.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot 1" src="images/glTrace-small.jpg" style="float:left;margin: 20px 20px"/></a>
        binary image that was loaded onto the DSP core and executed. This tool
        worked by reading all of the necessary data in the object files produced 
        from compiling the core software. Then it produced a binary image with
        all of the data from the object files formated in the way the 
        DSP OS kernel expected.
        <p/>As a side project I wrote a small interactive visualization application for this RTOS (screenshot 1).
        It simply interpreted the binary image produced from the RTOS build tool
        and displayed the memory regions in an OpenGL window. This was helpful
        because the module memory regions were not relocatable, which meant that 
        in order to use memory most efficiently the programmer had to make sure that
        there were few memory spaces between modules (i.e. no memory fragmentation). This visualization
        tool showed the module layout in memory, and any fragmentation was easily identified.
        The programmer could then change the module layout to minimize the fragmentation.

      <h3><a href="#">Examples of my 3D work</a></h3>
      <div>
        <p/>Below are some screenshots of 3D applications running on the BOPS DSP OpenGL
        <a href="images/quake.jpg"><img alt="Screenshot 1" src="images/quake-small.jpg" style="float:left;margin: 20px 20px"/></a>
        driver the Embedded Applications team developed.
        They show our implementation of a highly optimized OpenGL driver running on 
        a DSP core with many levels of parallelism. We did this by developing a dynamic
        link library that directed all OpenGL calls to the BOPS DSP core for processing,
        once the core was done processing the results of each frame were returned to the 
        host computer where they were rasterized.
        <p/>As a member of the Embedded Applications team I helped implement the
        <a href="images/LightingAppMain.gif"><img alt="Screenshot 2a" src="images/LightingAppMain-small.gif" style="float:left;margin: 20px 20px"/></a>
        OpenGL driver for the BOPS DSP. I was primarily responsible for the OpenGL 
        lighting model (shown in screenshot 2a), but I also helped get Quake III (screenshot 1) running on 
        the BOPS OpenGL driver. Once Quake was running I was responsible for maintaining

        developed this application to prove that BOPS could process all 8 of the lights
        in the OpenGL spec. The 4 spheres in the top window danced around sinusoidally, 
        and the 8 lights acted according to the settings in the lower window. The 
        user could change any of the values in the control window and the OpenGL scene 
        would be updated immediately.

      <h3><a href="#">ARM linux device driver developement</a></h3>
      <div>
        The beagle board is a development platform with a TI OMAP3530 processor
        which is based on the ARM Cortex-A8. I wrote an embedded linux device driver and application which drives 
        servos from a remote PC over 802.11 with a joystick as the input device. One servo is connected to the X 
        axis (steering servo), and the other to the Y axis (throttle servo).

      <h3><a href="#">ARM software, FPGA interface development</a></h3>
      <div>
        I wanted to try my hand at an HDL, so I decided to build a robot that can
        play simple songs on the piano. This project runs on the following hardware:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://gumstix.com">Gumstix overo</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://knjn.com">Altera Cyclone-II (Pluto-3)</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.linengineering.com/LinE/">2 Stepper motors</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://futaba-rc.com">2 RC Servos</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.st.com">4 l293b H-Bridges</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p/>
        The code for this project is hosted on <a class="anchor" href="https://github.com/cdesjardins/PlayerPiano">github.</a>
        <p/>
        The idea here was to learn some VHDL, so I developed VHDL code (using quartus-II under linux) 
        to drive both stepper motors, and servos. I created four 16bit registers in the FPGA which 
        can be written from the gumstix overo ARM processor. Here is a high level over view of 
        how the whole system works:
        <ul>
          <li>The ARM writes 8 gpios which are connected to input pins on the pluto-3 FPGA board.</li>
          <li>The ARM then writes a "clock" gpio to cause the FPGA to latch the input pins.</li>
          <li>Each register write is composed of the following three 8bit writes
            <ol>
              <li> is the register address.</li>
              <li> is the low order byte of the data.</li>
              <li> is the high order byte of the data.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>There are four registers, one for each stepper and servo.</li>
          <li>Writes to a stepper register indicates how many steps to take relative to the current position.</li>
          <li>Writes to a servo register indicates the pulse width to drive to the servo.</li>
        </ul>
        When it is all done the stepper motors will push or pull the servos down a small
        gantry system so that the servo can then strike the correct piano key.
        <p/>
        The stepper motors are driven by the FPGA through the l293b H-Bridges from STMicroelectronics, 
        the FPGA is setup so that four output pins are connected to the four H-Bridge input pins.
        Then the four H-Bridge output pins are connected to the stepper motors, I found that the
        steppers I have require about 1amp of current to run, and the H-Bridges
        are rated for 1amp max, so I used two H-Bridges hooked up in parallel to drive one
        stepper motor which effectively doubles the current the H-Bridges can handle.
        <p/>
        I also wrote code to program the FPGA from the gumstix overo, this makes the system
        more user friendly because when the fpga is powered off it loses it's configuration.
        There is a configurator/boot prom on the fpga board, but I didn't want to overwrite
        the default configuration so I decided to write my own programming code instead.

      <h3><a href="#">Arduino development</a></h3>
      <div>
        For my next project I thought it would be cool to make a custom made
        doorbell for my house. I used the following items for this project:
        <p/>
        <ul>
          <li>The cheapest glockenspiel I could find on e-bay.</li>
          <li><a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino Duemilanove</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.st.com">2 l293b H-Bridges</a></li>
          <li>8 small solenoids</li>
        </ul>
        <p/>
        To get the system running just connect 8 outputs from the arduino to the 8 h-bridge inputs (two 
        h-bridges gives 8 inputs, and 8 outputs). Then connect one wire from each solenoid to ground, 
        and the other wire from each solenoid to an output from the h-bridges. At this point you can 
        control all solenoids from the arduino. 
        <p/>
        To get the solenoids to work as a result of a doorbell ring, you must install some kind of button.
        On the duemilanove all of the I/Os are floating, that is ok for the solenoids, but
        for the button input a <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Button">pull-down resistor</a> is needed. 
        Once the button and pull down resistor are installed, an interrupt can be connected to the input line
        on a rising edge and when it fires you know someone has pushed the doorbell which means it is time to 
        play a tune.
